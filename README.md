# WP Block Toolkit

A simple collection of useful tools for WordPress Gutenberg block building.

## Styles

To include the editor styles, currently you need to add this to the top of your Gutenberg block's `_editor.scss`:

`@import "~@tnke/wp-block-toolkit/build/index.css";`

In the future, we'll figure out a better way to manage CSS in the toolkit.
